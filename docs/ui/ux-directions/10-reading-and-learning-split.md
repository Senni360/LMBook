# LMBook UX direction 10: Reading and learning split

Standalone implementation prompt. Prepared 2026-09-17. Status: candidate for critique; not a selected production redesign.

**Organising choice:** Material paired with a persistent learning activity.

**Protected signature — UX-10:** Separate the learning anchor from exploratory reading position. Preserve this mechanism during critique; its detailed requirements and demonstration appear below.

The direction-specific sections govern composition and navigation. Integrate the shared capabilities into that structure; do not add a permanent panel for each requirement.

## Assignment and boundaries

Build one complete, interactive LMBook UX prototype following this direction. It is one of ten candidates, not a skin switch inside a combined demo. Make it credible enough to evaluate as the eventual whole application. Preserve the Ink identity; change the navigation, information architecture and interaction mechanics as specified below. Do not collapse the direction into a generic dashboard or substitute a neighbouring candidate.

This file is a standalone build prompt. No shared preamble or companion file is required. If working inside the existing LMBook repository, inspect its product instructions, current components and design tokens before implementation. Build in an isolated prototype route, folder or worktree; preserve production behaviour, libraries and credentials. Do not migrate real vaults, call live providers, publish releases or replace the existing app as part of this prototype. If working outside the repository, produce a runnable prototype with instructions.

The owner requested ten strong candidates and one unconventional idea in each. The section marked **PROTECTED UNCONVENTIONAL IDEA** is an explicit owner requirement. Reviewers may refine its controls, language, discoverability and implementation. They must preserve its core behaviour and dedicated demonstration. Do not delete it, hide it behind an experimental flag, reduce it to static decoration or replace it with an ordinary interaction to make the review easier. Critique its risks honestly. If an accessibility or reliability problem cannot be resolved while retaining the behaviour, document the conflict for the owner rather than silently removing it. Protection is not a claim that the idea is already validated.

## Product truth and people

LMBook is a desktop learning and research app, with a reusable responsive web interface. People use it to read course material, maintain Markdown notes, ask source-grounded questions, practise vocabulary or concepts, and listen to detailed audio lessons. Some are new to these tools; some bring a large Obsidian vault. Dutch, English and German content must fit naturally.

A notebook and an attached Obsidian vault belong to one experience. Distinguish opening an existing folder in place from copying material into a new notebook. Explain that saving an attached note also changes the file Obsidian reads. Original sources, editable notes, generated interpretations and historical evidence are distinct objects. A renamed note retains its identity; a shared-file conflict cannot be solved by silently overwriting it.

The app can prepare suggestions and proposed edits in the background. Support the three chosen control modes: ask every time; apply straightforward changes and ask about harder ones; full control within the selected scope. For the prototype start with an explicitly labelled ask-every-time demonstration setting, not a new production default. Demonstrate the other modes in settings and activity history. Full control still has scope, revision checks and undo. Model confidence must never be shown as proof that a fact is correct.

Luna supplies generated explanations through the existing Codex/OpenAI connection. Optional Jev checks, OpenRouter services and local search belong in Connections settings, with concise explanations of where data goes. Do not place model names in primary learning navigation. Mock onboarding must distinguish connected, unavailable and offline states. Existing saved content remains accessible offline. Separate model downloaded, checked and enabled; show indexing separately. These are supporting settings, not a forced tour before browsing the prototype.

## Common evaluation material

Use this same fictional data contract so reviewers can compare interaction choices fairly:

- Notebook **Water and society**, a research project with an outline, eight authored core notes, two notes named `Definitions.md` in different folders, a PDF excerpt, a source recording transcript, two chats and an 18-minute lesson paused at **07:42**. Give each object a stable ID and revision.
- A **291-note** stress view with realistic nested paths and long titles. Extra fixture notes may be generated deterministically and labelled illustrative. They must be openable. Avoid hundreds of fully mounted editors and pretend search results that open nothing.
- A source passage: “In the pilot survey, 12 of 40 participating households reported moving after the reservoir opened.” A separate passage says the survey did not establish why they moved. An intentionally overbroad draft claim reads: “The reservoir displaced 30% of all households.” The review should expose the population and causality limitations, not simply certify or reject the whole topic.
- A pending link suggestion with quotes from both notes; a second uncertain suggestion; a dismissed suggestion; an already applied change with Undo; and a stale suggestion whose source was edited externally.
- An external note edit and an unsaved local edit to exercise three-way conflict review. Include one independent addition and one incompatible definition change. A deletion is intentional unless the user says otherwise.
- A second notebook **Duits — hoofdstuk 11–15**, with a saved editable deck containing these exact twelve fixture pairs: `die Entscheidung — de beslissing`; `die Erfahrung — de ervaring`; `der Unterschied — het verschil`; `die Voraussetzung — de voorwaarde`; `der Zusammenhang — het verband`; `die Entwicklung — de ontwikkeling`; `die Ursache — de oorzaak`; `die Folge — het gevolg`; `die Maßnahme — de maatregel`; `die Möglichkeit — de mogelijkheid`; `der Vergleich — de vergelijking`; `die Auswirkung — het effect`. The first eleven occur in the synthetic vocabulary source; the last is explicitly labelled a generated draft translation. The supplied pair `die Folge — het gevolg` has an incomplete pairing review. Preserve supplied wording exactly. Mark all material illustrative; it is not the owner's real idioom.
- A pending download, indexing progress, provider timeout, denied save and missing attachment. Trigger these from a discreet prototype scenario menu. Their simulated nature must be clear. Counters must match actual fixture state.

Use source excerpts long enough to test reading, and a note long enough to require scrolling. Include narrow panes, empty notebooks, long German words, diacritics, multiline titles and a mixed-language conversation. Avoid fake scientific results and fabricated learner-success metrics.

Use these eight core paths: `01 Questions/Research question.md`, `02 Methods/Pilot survey.md`, `02 Methods/Definitions.md`, `03 Findings/Relocation.md`, `03 Findings/Definitions.md`, `04 Discussion/Claim draft.md`, `04 Discussion/Open questions.md`, and `05 Learning/Study notes.md`. Put the survey quotation and the no-causality qualification in separate sources, and the overbroad claim in Claim draft. Keep the two Definitions notes meaningfully different: one describes survey membership; the other distinguishes reported moving from displacement. Put the long reading fixture in Relocation. All other text is openly fictional and should remain consistent with these excerpts.

Store suggestion state by identity: suggestion A is a supported contextual link awaiting review; B is uncertain; C is dismissed; D has been applied and can be undone; E was prepared against an older revision. Viewing a suggestion is not accepting it. Keep these identities consistent when the same suggestion appears in a note, notification and review list.

## Visual and interaction floor

Keep the Ink visual language: paper-like surfaces, charcoal text, stable subtly imperfect pen contours, restrained accent colour and precise reading typography. Offer light/dark/system and the existing accent choices. Drawn decoration must not reduce legibility, shift hit targets or change randomly on render. Reserve highlighting for a meaningful selection or state.

Composition should express this direction through density, reading width, grouping and focus. Do not create ten identical shells with different labels. Prefer clear headings and spacious text over framing every item as a card. The main task should remain identifiable when suggestions and background work exist.

Motion explains opening, closing, focus and relationships. Navigation direction must match the actual destination; do not slide every view from the same side. No animation may delay typing, save feedback, cancellation or concealment of a flashcard answer. Reduced motion preserves state changes without spatial movement.

All actions need accessible labels and visible keyboard focus. Provide keyboard/menu alternatives to dragging, hovering and selecting text. Controls should have comfortable targets; tiny decorative close marks need larger hit areas. Dialogs return focus to the invoking control. Close means close the view; delete/remove must be separately named. Save failure preserves the draft. Closing a live job's view does not silently cancel the job. Closing unsaved work must retain recoverable local state or offer a clear recovery choice.

Resizable panes and sizeable work surfaces need pointer and keyboard controls, sensible minimum sizes and reset. Honour the owner's interest in width and height adjustment without putting grips on every message or inline suggestion. Specify which boundaries resize below. At 1440×900 and 1280×800 maintain a useful reading column. At 1024×768 reduce peripheral UI. At 390×844 and 200% zoom preserve the same tasks through accessible sequential views; never squeeze desktop panes into unreadable columns. Avoid competing nested scroll regions.

## Functional requirements that every direction must retain

- **Getting started:** mock a concise account check, then create a notebook or connect a vault. Import can target a new or existing notebook. Show scope and completion; partial import is not complete import. No recurring onboarding for an existing library.
- **Notes and sources:** search, open, edit, save feedback, recover a draft, review an external change, create a file and export. Vault export and full LMBook backup are distinct. Prototype exports may use fixtures but cannot claim to include nonexistent files or recordings.
- **Ask and evidence:** show selected sources before sending, with select-all/clear-all and individual selection. Make clear whether the selection is passages, files or a whole notebook. Changing current scope affects future requests, not the evidence attached to earlier answers. Source citations reopen the actual examined snapshot with current-version differences visible.
- **Practice:** open an existing deck, edit the underlying pair list, switch language direction without generating again, choose flip or typing practice and retain controller mappings. Reset the visible face before advancing so the next answer cannot flash on screen. Practice remains available with clearly marked incomplete review. Concept cards and optional generated translations remain supported; generated translations are distinguishable and never replace supplied pairs silently.
- **Listen:** resume, seek, pause, change speed and open transcript/chapters. Show where contextual help belongs. If no playable demo audio is bundled, label transport behaviour as simulated. Never claim a real recording was generated. Generation preparation retains learning goals, source treatment and relevant settings; saved playback should not open a generation form first.
- **AI assistance:** give a discoverable home to link suggestions, claim evidence, argument review, source conflicts, contextual terminology, import cleanup, script rehearsal and audio help. These are proposed experiences, not claims that the production features already work. Use the same few interaction patterns for them. Each finding shows what was examined, uncertainty, proposed action and dismissal. Unavailable AI must not block ordinary editing or playback.
- **Background work and changes:** progress, Stop/Cancel, retry and completion belong somewhere consistent. A cancellation must prevent late results from silently appearing as accepted changes. Record automatic changes visibly. Undo should preserve unrelated subsequent edits; when a precise undo is impossible, offer a comparison instead of overwriting. Dismissed suggestions stay dismissed until meaningful new evidence, not simply a tab switch.

## Direction thesis and first impression

Make the relationship between material and learning immediately visible. The left pane shows a note or source; the right hosts Ask, Explain, Practice or Listen. A compact material browser opens when needed. The learner can change activity without losing the material they were using.

Start with a readable source and an empty Ask or Explain surface whose scope is explicit. An existing notebook restores its last pairing. Do not prefill a confident AI summary just to make the screen look populated. A fresh notebook invites adding material or writing a note before suggesting generation.

## Navigation, pairings and state

- A notebook header contains material browsing and a stable activity switcher. The material browser supports paths, search, source type and open note creation. Keep opening a source separate from selecting it for AI.
- The left pane has a compact recent-source switcher with preview and pin options, not a long global tab strip. The right remembers each activity's local state: question draft, explanation, current practice card or episode position.
- Pairings are explicit. A deck may use several sources while the reader shows only one; name that difference rather than implying the visible page supplies every answer. Opening an unrelated note cannot silently change the selected sources of the active chat.
- Both panes can expand to full width and restore the earlier split. Resize their widths and optional transcript/evidence heights. On narrow screens use Material / Activity with the current source title and activity name visible. Switching preserves positions and input focus appropriately.
- Closing a temporary source preview returns to the prior source. Closing an activity view returns to its library without deleting the artifact. Existing background audio has a visible transport and an intentional stop action.

## Placement of features and routine workflows

The material browser owns files, import and new/existing notebook destinations. Notes edit directly in the material pane with visible shared-file save state and conflict recovery. Sources retain originals; imported cleanup opens an inspectable reading-view comparison.

The right activity toolbar shows its source scope and relevant controls. Ask supports selecting passages/files with select-all/clear-all. Practice exposes direction and typing/flip choices, and a separate Edit list action. Listen leads with playback, chapters and I'm lost; generation preparation is a separate screen that returns to the current pairing.

Notebook export, backup, Connections and local-model readiness stay in the main menu. Nothing requires users to keep a source open merely to play an existing episode or practise an existing deck; the reader may collapse or show the referenced material on demand.

## AI suggestions, edits and background work

Use restrained markers beside affected source/note passages and a labelled Review action. Selecting a suggestion temporarily opens its review in the activity pane with a clear Return to Ask/Practice/Listen action. Preserve any unfinished activity input. Do not stack a third full-width AI column beside the pair.

Notebook-wide suggestions are reachable through Review's filter. A change comparison names whether it alters a note, an organisational relationship or only generated draft text. An uncertain term distinction shows both definitions rather than merging them automatically. Background activity uses a small status drawer that does not replace the reader or activity unexpectedly.

## PROTECTED UNCONVENTIONAL IDEA — UX-10: two reading positions

**Core requirement:** keep an explicit learning anchor separate from the reader's exploratory position, so looking elsewhere does not lose the passage the current activity is about.

When a user chooses **Use this passage**, set a labelled learning anchor containing source identity, revision and range. The material pane can then scroll freely, follow a reference or preview a different document. A quiet **Return to learning passage** control retains the original anchor. The activity continues to show what it is based on; the latest visible paragraph never becomes implicit AI scope.

Selecting a citation or audio reference may open an exploratory passage while keeping the original learning anchor. Distinguish the two with labels and restrained markers, not colour alone. **Use this passage instead** changes the anchor for a future question or draft only after an explicit choice. Existing answers, saved cards and recorded episodes retain their examined sources. Merely changing the anchor must not regenerate anything.

Returning to the learning passage restores that passage's reader position without seeking the audio or erasing a typed answer. Conversely, returning to the activity restores its actual current state, not an earlier bookmark. If the source has changed, expose the anchored historical excerpt and a current-version comparison. If the anchor cannot be located, do not scroll to a plausible but unrelated paragraph. Preserve readable context and offer choose-a-new-anchor recovery.

**Protected acceptance:** exploration and learning scope remain independently identifiable, return restores the intended passage and changing scope is explicit. A simple scroll bookmark or automatically synchronised reader does not satisfy this idea.

**Demonstration:** anchor the survey passage, ask a question, explore the methods appendix, inspect a citation and return to the anchored passage without changing the question's sources. Repeat while audio is playing and after the source changes. On a phone demonstrate both positions through Material / Activity navigation without hidden state.

## Conflict checks and tradeoff to evaluate

The two positions must simplify orientation, not introduce technical terminology. Prefer learner-facing labels such as About this passage and You're reading, with an optional explanation on first use. Do not enforce an anchor for every broad notebook question; support explicit multi-source scope. This candidate should make source-grounded learning fluid, but evaluate whether two equally large panes become wasteful during standalone practice or audio playback.

## Required prototype delivery and evaluation

Deliver a runnable implementation, a short run guide and an honest behaviour inventory. Identify implemented interactions, simulated providers and remaining limitations. Keep data/state changes meaningful: a dismissed suggestion disappears, an accepted edit changes the note, Undo restores only that change, and a saved draft survives a reload when storage succeeds. A storage failure must show an unsaved/recovery state. Do not add production migrations or a new automated test suite; use existing checks where available and perform manual scenario evaluation.

Avoid building unrelated infrastructure to complete the prototype. Use a small deterministic fixture adapter for simulated filesystem changes, providers and jobs. Implement the navigation and state transitions faithfully; do not fake a successful save, cancelled job or export through a toast alone. Add a labelled reset-demo action that affects only prototype data. Source paragraphs and output drafts must remain selectable and readable rather than being painted into screenshots.

Provide screenshots of the initial notebook, note editing, evidence review, suggestion comparison, practice, audio and the protected unconventional idea. Inspect actual rendered output in light and dark modes and at desktop and narrow widths. Check focus visibility and reduced motion. Record what was actually checked; screenshots do not prove keyboard behaviour, real provider quality or educational benefit.

Run these common journeys without an explanatory tour:

1. Create a new notebook from selected vault notes, then distinguish its copied content from an attached shared folder.
2. Find the correct `Definitions.md`, edit it, leave and return, then recover from a simulated save failure and an external edit.
3. Ask about relocation using exactly two selected sources. Open a citation, inspect the qualification and return to the question with its draft and place intact.
4. Inspect, accept and undo a link; dismiss another; then attempt a stale proposal and show why it needs another review.
5. Open the saved German deck, switch direction, type an answer and advance repeatedly without revealing upcoming answers. Edit a pair and verify the new value is used without regeneration.
6. Resume the episode at 07:42, request help, inspect a source and resume from the intentional playback position.
7. Start indexing, keep using the notebook, cancel, then retry. Inspect the difference between installed, checked, enabled and indexed.
8. Perform the direction-specific protected-idea demonstration and its failure case. Repeat its essential action with keyboard-only input.

Judge this direction on task completion, discoverability, orientation, source-scope clarity, recovery, distraction and reading comfort. Record observed detours and state loss. Do not infer user approval or claim usability gains without participants. The unconventional idea passes only if it remains present, is understandable, solves its stated problem and has a usable fallback path. Its novelty alone is not success.

Finish with the strongest reason to choose this candidate, its most serious tradeoff, what evidence would change that recommendation and the next unresolved design question. Do not declare it the winner before comparing the other candidates.

## Research basis and limits

This is a product-specific design hypothesis. Its detailed mechanics have not been validated with LMBook users. General guidance informs the evaluation rather than proving the concept:

- [Nielsen Norman Group: usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) — inspect consistency, visibility, recovery and familiar language.
- [Nielsen Norman Group: progressive disclosure](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/) — assess whether secondary controls remain discoverable.
- [W3C APG: tabs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) and [window splitters](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/windowsplitter/) — consult for applicable keyboard and semantic behaviour; guidance does not replace testing the implementation with assistive technology.
